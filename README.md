## Requirements

This repository has been tested with the following packages:

- Python == 3.8.13
- PyTorch == 1.11.0
- PyTorch Geometric == 2.0.4

Please follow official instructions to install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) and [Pytorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html).

## Important Hyper-parameters

- `--dataset`: name of the dataset. Could be one of `['Cora', 'CiteSeer', 'PubMed', 'Amazon-Photo', 'Amazon-Computers', 'Coauthor-CS']`. 
- `--data_path`: the path to the dataset. The dataset will be downloaded to this path automatically when the code is executed for the first time.
- `--imb_ratio`: imbalance ratio.
- `--net`: GNN backbone. Could be one of `['GCN, GAT, SAGE']`.
- `--gdc`: way to get the weighted graph. Could be one of `['ppr', 'hk', 'none']`.

Please refer to [args.py](args.py) for the full hyper-parameters.

## How to Run

Pass the above hyper-parameters to `main.py`. For example:

```
python main.py --dataset Cora --data_path dataset/ --imb_ratio 100 --net GCN --gdc ppr
```
